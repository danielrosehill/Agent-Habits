# Where everything lives

Three locations, three lifecycles. Putting a file in the wrong one fails in a
predictable way, so the split is worth knowing before writing anything.

| | Path | Lifecycle | Privacy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Plugin** | wherever Claude Code installed it | replaced wholesale on `/plugin update` | public |
| **Library** | `~/.claude-user-data/sops/` (configurable) | inside a git repo you own; diverges forever | private |
| **Vault** | `~/.claude-plugins/habits/` | survives updates, committed nowhere | local, never synced |

**Never write into the plugin directory at run time.** It works until the first
update and then loses the data silently.

The user-content / machine-config split, and why the root is
`~/.claude-user-data/`: [`user-data-convention.md`](user-data-convention.md).

## The library

```
~/.claude-user-data/                 the git repo — private, mirrored
└── sops/                            the library
    ├── INDEX.md                     generated — the only file read by default
    ├── README.md                    from templates/library-README.md at init
    ├── deploy-the-site.md           one procedure, one file
    ├── close-the-month.md
    └── archive/
        └── 2026-03-04-old-deploy.md
```

**Flat and readable on purpose.** The files sit directly in the folder so that
opening it in a file manager shows the procedures themselves. `INDEX.md` and
`README.md` are therefore reserved names and can never be SOP ids; `sop.py`
refuses them rather than shadowing the index.

**The repo root is a level up.** `~/.claude-user-data/` is the git repo and the
library is a subfolder, so `git -C <library>` works but `git add -A` at the top
would sweep in other tools' folders. Use `sop.py repo` to resolve the root and
stage only the SOP paths.

Resolution order for the library path, highest first:

1. `$CLAUDE_SOPS_DIR`
2. `library` in `~/.claude-plugins/habits/config.json`
3. `$CLAUDE_USER_DATA/sops` — the shared cross-plugin root, if set
4. `~/.claude-user-data/sops`

`python3 scripts/sop.py path` prints the winner. Use it rather than assuming —
on a machine where the user keeps the library somewhere else, a hardcoded
`~/.claude-user-data/sops` silently creates a second, empty library.

## The vault

```json
{
  "library": "~/.claude-user-data/sops",
  "repo": "<owner>/claude-user-data",
  "remote": "github",
  "claude_md": "~/.claude/CLAUDE.md",
  "seeded": "2026-08-12"
}
```

Machine-specific truth, nothing else. No SOP content, no credential values —
credentials are referenced by name or `op://` path and resolved at use.

Rules that apply to it:

- **Read it always, write it only when asked**, and say the path when you do.
- **Never fail because it is missing.** Absent vault means defaults; a first run
  works with no setup at all.

## The `CLAUDE.md` snippet

One delimited block in the user's user-level `CLAUDE.md`, so that a session
which never touches an SOP still knows the library exists. Exact text and the
rules for editing it: [`claude-md-snippet.md`](claude-md-snippet.md).

## Why the split exists

The library could have been skills — one skill per procedure, in
`~/.claude/skills/`. That fails on two counts.

**Context.** Every skill's name and description is loaded every session. Forty
procedures is forty descriptions permanently resident, and most sessions use
none of them. One index file read on demand costs nothing until it is read.

**Privacy.** Real procedures name real repos, hosts, accounts and people. They
are not shareable and should not live in the same tree as things that are. The
plugin is public because the machinery generalises; the library is private
because the procedures do not.
